The Tools package is a collection of utility functions for working with the components. Currently this is the home of
two important pieces:

- A loader of Visualize.js
- TypeScript interfaces for working with Visualize.js in your IDE (work in progress)

## Installation and Usage

More information about the installation and usage can be
